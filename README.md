## My Git config

Contains:
* git aware shell prompt
* some git command aliases
* shell scripts for some git tasks

## Install using vcsh

Install https://github.com/harendra-kumar/config-bash first. Then:

```
vcsh clone https://github.com/harendra-kumar/config-git
```

## Troubleshooting

If the prompt does not correctly show the branch symbol or shows some garbage
then most likely you do not have
[powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git) installed. Note, my
vim config repo installs them automatically, so if you have installed that it
should just work.
